# Important Note :-
User profile pictures load perfectly on the mobile app using images from the randomuser.me API.

However, on Flutter Web, the images don't show up because of browser security rules called CORS. These rules block images from some websites if they donâ€™t have special permissions.

That's why I added a profile pictures showing the letters of the user's first and last name instead of the profile picture in the web app. This keeps the app looking neat and working well on web.
